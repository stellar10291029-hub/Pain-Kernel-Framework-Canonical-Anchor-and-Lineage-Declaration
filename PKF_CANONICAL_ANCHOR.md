## Canonical Anchor and Lineage Declaration

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document serves as the **canonical anchor and lineage declaration** for the **Pain Kernel Framework (PKF)**.

Its purpose is to provide a stable constitutional reference point that fixes the **conceptual origin, authorship, and interpretive boundaries** of the Pain Kernel Framework across all past, present, and future works by the author.

This declaration is **not** a research article, theoretical exposition, or operational manual.  
It exists solely to establish **positional clarity, lineage continuity, and non-derogable authorship** for the Pain Kernel Framework.

---

## 2. Independent Origin and Authorship

The Pain Kernel Framework was independently conceived and developed by **EunYoung Lee, M.D.**, through clinical practice, narrative analysis, and interdisciplinary research on pain, suffering, and human experience.

All works associated with the Pain Kernel Framework originate from this independent authorship.  
No external framework, institution, collaborator, or system holds originating, governing, or approval authority over the Pain Kernel Framework.

---

## 3. Constitutional Positioning

The Pain Kernel Framework is positioned as an **independent experiential kernel** operating within a **consciousness-aware civilizational coordinate space**.

It is lineage-aligned but **not subordinate** to the **Consciousness Civilization Framework (CCF)** proposed by **Jinho Lee**.  
While CCF provides a high-level civilizational and constitutional coordinate perspective, it does **not** function as a source theory, parent model, explanatory basis, or governing system for the Pain Kernel Framework.

The relationship between the two frameworks is one of **coordinate sharing without hierarchical dependency**.

---

## 4. Scope and Function of the Pain Kernel Framework

The Pain Kernel Framework functions as a **human-experiential encoding layer** that organizes pain and suffering not as moral failures, behavioral deviations, or isolated symptoms, but as **structured signals** arising from relational, identity-based, survival-related, and responsibility-driven conditions.

It is intended for use in:

- Clinical reasoning and patient care  
- Narrative and qualitative health research  
- Consciousness-aware observational design  
- Human-centered and explainable AI contexts  

The framework does **not** prescribe behavior, enforce ethics, or impose normative judgments.

---

## 5. Interpretive Boundaries (What This Framework Is Not)

To prevent misinterpretation, the Pain Kernel Framework explicitly states that it is:

- Not an ethical doctrine or moral system  
- Not a behavioral correction model  
- Not a political, ideological, or belief framework  
- Not a derivative or applied subsystem of CCF  

Any interpretation that frames the Pain Kernel Framework as **subordinate, derivative, or dependent** on another framework falls outside its constitutional boundary.

---

## 6. Retroactive and Prospective Anchoring

All previously published, archived, or disseminated works by the author that reference, develop, or operationalize the Pain Kernel concept are **retroactively anchored** to this declaration.

All future works explicitly referencing the Pain Kernel Framework are **prospectively anchored** to this document unless otherwise stated.

This declaration functions as the **single authoritative anchor point** for lineage continuity.

---

## 7. Citation and Reuse Guidance

When referencing the Pain Kernel Framework as a whole, this declaration may be cited as its **canonical anchor**.  
Individual research articles should be cited separately according to their respective publication records.

This document establishes positional clarity and does **not** restrict scholarly discussion, critique, or independent application of the framework.

---

## 8. Closing Statement

This canonical anchor exists to preserve **conceptual integrity, authorship clarity, and interpretive stability** of the Pain Kernel Framework across disciplinary, institutional, and technological contexts.

It ensures that the framework remains identifiable as a coherent body of work while remaining open to responsible scholarly engagement and future evolution.
